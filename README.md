# Evaluating Chart Libraries for Flexible and Adaptable Data Visualization
This repo contains the result of my thesis on the topic **Evaluating Chart Libraries for Flexible and Adaptable Data Visualization** 

In a preliminary round basic charts were created with numerous charting libraries to chose the most fitting candidates.

Next, the top picks Chart.js, ApexCharts and ECharts were further examined by implementing the three use cases of a Trend Line chart, Pareto chart and a Sankey chart. 
The charts were evaluated based on the criteria: ease of use (based on the implementation), responsiveness, community and support, integration flexibility and bundle size.
